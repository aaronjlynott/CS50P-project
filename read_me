 # Anti-Aging App (AAA(No RP))
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description:
    ###### This application was inspired and created with the goal of helping the elderly (everyone above the iPad generation) feel young(er) through the eyes and ears of today's youth.  This application will help the user accomplish a few items rather quickly by inputting their age.  Based upon the user's age, this application will access Billboard's Top 100 songs and select a song, again based upon their age.  As a general guideline, the older the user the higher up on the chart they will begin their youthful transformation.
    ###### A few exceptions to the general guideline is that if the user is less than a year-old, the application instructs them that they are too young to access this list and that the user should begin with classical music such as Chopin.  If they are older than 100, the application instructs the user that they will start at the top of the list!
    ###### Once the user inputs their age and the application accesses the Top 100, selects that song and then retuns that song.  In doing so the application also writes the current Top 100 list for that week as a resource for the user if they desire.  The application is not yet making the user any younger, that magic happens at the next step.  In addition to selecting and returning a current song, the application accesses that song from YouTube and returns the song as a link.  The user will get younger by watching the video and listening to a popular song that they may not be familiar with (I can say in making this application, I have become quite a bit more younger than when I began the project).  After completion of the video, the user is then prompted if they would like to continue to get younger.  If they respond with yes, the application gives them another song and video that they have not yet viewed.  This option continues until the user responds with no and is then reieved with a compliment from the application.
    #### The inception of this project began with music as I am passionate about music - I mean own 1,000s of CD's, create and used to work in a music store passionate.  I was inspired by Dr. Malan especially furing the week when he created a web scraper for iTunes to return Weezer songs.  I began my project by creating the web scraper first and then it quickly became a project of what else can I do?
    #### As an educator, I am often amused at the 'experienced' teachers and how often they forget what they were like when they were young.  It was my intention for people to become more knowledgeable about modern popular music and maybe even appreicate music and videos that they might not otherwise value.
